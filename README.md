**# AI_ART_Generator**
Python-based AI Art Generator using GANs to create unique digital artwork. Features include multiple art generation and p5.js export. Implemented in Google Colab, this project explores the intersection of machine learning and visual arts, ideal for creative technologists.

**Features**

Generates unique abstract art using a trained GAN model
Allows for the creation of multiple art pieces in a single run
Provides functionality to export generated art for use in p5.js
Implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras

**Installation**

Clone this repository:
Copygit clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-art-generator.git

Install the required dependencies:
Copypip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn


**Usage**

Open the ai_art_generator.ipynb notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
Run all cells to train the GAN and generate art.
Use the generate_art() function to create new art pieces.
To use the generated art in p5.js, use the export_to_p5js() function and copy the output into your p5.js sketch.

Example Output
[Insert a sample image of generated art here]
Future Improvements

Implement more diverse art styles
Add user controls for art generation parameters
Create a web interface for easy art generation
